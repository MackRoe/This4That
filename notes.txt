QUESTIONS:
    "make get and post" ... was this for the update_profile ?
    "in signup page change view" ... meant what?

ISSUES:
    profile page not displaying user's location
    console displaying error 404 "GET /styles.css HTTP/1.1" on page reload
    attempted to impose custom font unsuccessfully
    .gitignore not working
    attempted to correct following the directions at
        https://bytefreaks.net/programming-2/my-gitignore-file-is-ignored-by-git-and-it-does-not-work
        now notes.txt does not appear in directory tree

DONE:
    'django.contrib.postgres' added to INSTALLED_APPS
    ran pip3 freeze => requirements.txt to update
    reverted requirements.txt
    commented out "# 'django.contrib.postgres',"
